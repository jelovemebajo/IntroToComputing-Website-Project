        <h2 style="color: white">4x4 automatic</h2>
        <p>A 4×4 car or truck, additionally referred to as four-wheel drive (4WD) or 4-by-4, 
            indicates a system in which an automobile's engine powers all 4 wheels uniformly. 
            Generally speaking, when it comes to vehicles, there are only 4 choices: four-wheel drive, all-wheel drive, 
            front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive.</p>

        <h1>Honda</h1>
        <h2>4x4 automatic</h2>
        <p>Both Honda 4WD and AWD vehicles rely on differentials located on the axles to divide the power between rear and front wheels, 
            according to Ranker. Because the engine powers all of the wheels in an AWD vehicle, 
            the others can compensate if one begins to lose traction or slip.</p>

        <p>Full-Time 4WD operates by default in four-wheel drive and can travel safely and securely on all surfaces. 
            The system uses either a clutch or a center differential to allow the front and rear wheels to turn at varying speeds. 
            Whether the road is covered in snow or is dry as dirt, this system can be utilized confidently.</p>
